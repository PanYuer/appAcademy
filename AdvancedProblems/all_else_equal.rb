# Write a method all_else_equal that takes in an array of numbers. The method should
# return the element of the array that is equal to half of the sum of all elements of
# the array. If there is no such element, the method should return nil.

p all_else_equal([2, 4, 3, 10, 1]) #=> 10, because the sum of all elements is 20
p all_else_equal([6, 3, 5, -9, 1]) #=> 3, because the sum of all elements is 6
p all_else_equal([1, 2, 3, 4])     #=> nil, because the sum of all elements is 10 and there is no 5 in the array
