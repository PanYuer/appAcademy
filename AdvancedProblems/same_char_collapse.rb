# Write a method same_char_collapse that takes in a string and returns a
# collapsed version of the string. To collapse the string, we repeatedly
# delete 2 adjacent characters that are the same until there are no such
# adjacent characters. If there are multiple pairs that can be collapsed,
# delete the leftmost pair. For example, we take the following steps to
# collapse "zzzxaaxy": zzzxaaxy -> zxaaxy -> zxxy -> zy

  collapsible = true

  while collapsible

    chars.each.with_index do |char, i|
      if chars[i] == chars[i + 1]
        chars[i] = ""     # delete this char
        chars[i + 1] = ""
        collapsible = true
      end

puts same_char_collapse("zzzxaaxy")   #=> "zy"
